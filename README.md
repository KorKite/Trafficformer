# Trafficformer
  Trafficformer: Transformer based traffic prediction model, code of paper

# What is this?
  Trafficformer is a deep learning model to predict web traffic data. 
  We tested our model using wikipedia dataset. 
  
# For usage
  You can use our model with fine-tunning your own dataset
  For training, you have to prepare your own dataset with .traff file
  For inference, N days dataset with .traff file is needed.

  ABSTRACT="In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that can predict future
  traffic. The proposed Transformer-based model is evaluated using the visit
  data of popular Wikipedia pages for more than 2 years through multiple
  accessing devices such as mobile and desktop. The experiment results
  demonstrate that the proposed model can predict the future traffic with
  high accuracy."
