# Trafficformer
  Trafficformer: Transformer based traffic prediction model, code of paper

# What is this?
  Trafficformer is a deep learning model to predict web traffic data. 
  We tested our model using wikipedia dataset. 
  
# For usage
  You can use our model with fine-tunning your own dataset
  For training, you have to prepare your own dataset with .traff file
  For inference, N days dataset with .traff file is needed.
